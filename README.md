# This is the source code for my AP Computer Science Principals Final Project

I created this program independently over the course of 3 days, quickly wrapping up the final project for my AP Computer Science Principals class as a Junior in High School

This was a test of my abilities to work efficiently and effectively to complete the task at hand, and completed the work accurately weeks ahead of the due date.
