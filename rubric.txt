# Definitions - 
    Functionality - basically what the program is **doing**
    Sequencing - the specific order that the computer processes the code in
    Selection - in a for() loop (or other iteration), the "selection" is the if() statement inside of it that pulls out specific pieces of data and returns them
    Iteration - basically just a for() loop. the actual definition is basically going through each piece of data in a data collection
    Condition - when you see this think "if() statement". This is the conditions something has to meet in order for a piece of code to run differently, or run at all
    Procedure - this is literally just a function. Its defined as "a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values"

# Video - 
    Demonstrate: {
        the input you are giving the program

        what the program is doing with the input (functionality)

        the output
    }

# Written Response - 
    Row 1: {
        describe overall purpose of the program

        describe the functionality of your program you demonstrated in the video you took in words (describe what the program did)

        describe the input and output of the program that you demonstrated in your video
    }
    
    Row 2: {
        include two program segments:
            - one that shows how data is being stored in a list or data structure
            - one that then shows how that data is being used in fulfilling the program's purpose
        
        indentify the name of the variable being used to represent the list

        describe what the data in the list is *representing* in the program
    }

    Row 3: {
        show how a list is being used to manage the complexity of the program

        then tell about how the code could not be written without the list, or how it would have been written differently without that list
    }

    Row 4: {
        include two more program segments:
            - one that shows a function that you wrote yourself that has at least one parameter (parameter has to have an effect on the functionality of the function)
            - one where that function is being called with the parameter
        
        describe what the function does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program
    }

    Row 5: {
        include a code segment of a for() loop that has 
            sequencing (you prob have this already)
            selection (if statement)
            iteration (is a for loop)
        
        explain what the loop is doing in enough detail that someone else could write it easily
    }

    Row 6: {
        describe two calls with parameters to the function that you described in row 4 that have different parameters
        
        describe the conditions being tested by each call to the procedure (have an if() statement inside of your function that determines an outcome and describe it)
        
        identify and describe the result of the two calls
    }
    
    Extra notes: {
        When the rubric says "has to be student-developed" that basically means just don't use a library or a very specific function from another piece of code
    }
